# Java Visualizer

Our project aims to help users visualize data structures (such as trees and linked lists) and sorting algorithms.

Our project works by taking each data structure and representing them with boxes, circles, and/or arrows, depending on the data structure. The user is able to change data structures by pressing on butons, and add and delete numbers as input.

To run the visualizer:
1. `processing Visualizer/Visualizer.pde`
2. press run in processing
