# Java Visualizer

Our project aims to help users visualize data structures (such as trees and linked lists) and sorting alogirthms.

Our project works by taking each data structure and representing them with boxes, circles or arrows, depending on the data structure. The user will be able to add and delete inputs.

To run the visualizer, press run in Processing.
