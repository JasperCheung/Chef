# Java Visualizer

Our project aims to help users visualize data structures (such as trees and linked lists) and sorting algorithms.

Our project works by taking each data structure and representing them with boxes, circles, and/or arrows, depending on the data structure. The user is able to change data structures by pressing on butons, and add and delete numbers as input.

To run the visualizer:
1. `processing Visualizer/Visualizer.pde`
2. press run in processing

Once you run the program, the interface is pretty simple to navigate through.
Along the top, there is a row of data structures that you can click through until you've reached your desired structure.
Depending on what the data structure is, you'll be able to add, add-at-index, pop, push, and do a variety of other methods.
For the ArrayList data structure, bubble, selection, and insertion sorts were also added to help users visualize what happens
after a number of passes. In the Binary Search Tree data structure, pre, in, and post traversal buttons were added.

Enjoy!
