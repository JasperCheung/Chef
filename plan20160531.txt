PLANZ

Most crucial job:
- identifying how to create the data structures we plan to implement in Processing.
- Figuring out how the user will input his/her elements of the data structures (mouse click, typing?)
- How will the animations work?

Core functionality components:
- Accurate display of data structures

Nonessential components:
- color
- placement of objects

Prereq components:
- Having the display of the sorts/ structures down
- Creating the visualization of an empty data structure before elements are filled in

Delegated tasks:
- create methods to display the data structures

Collaboration tasks:
- protect design

TIMELINE:
- start with getting an array displayed (simplest, we hope)
- other data structures
- sorts!!
