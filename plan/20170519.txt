PLAN

Most crucial job:
- identifying how to create and display the data structures we plan to implement in Processing.
- Figuring out how the user will input his/her elements of the data structures (mouse click, typing?)
- How will the animations work?

Core functionality components:
- Accurate display of data structures
- User input of data

Nonessential components:
- color
- placement of objects
- animation

Prereq components:
- Having the display of the structures down before doing algorithms

Delegated tasks:
- create methods to display the data structures

Collaboration tasks:
- design

TIMELINE:
- start with getting an array displayed (simplest, we hope)
- other data structures
- algorithms!!
