PLAN

Most crucial job:
- Adding algorithms 

Core functionality components:
- Accurate display of data structures
- User input of data

Nonessential components:
- color
- placement of objects
- animation

Prereq components:
- Having the display of the structures down before doing algorithms (check)

Delegated tasks:
- create methods to display the data structures
- user interface work

Collaboration tasks:
- design/ UI

TIMELINE:
- start with getting an array displayed (simplest, we hope)
- other data structures
- handling user interface and user input
- algorithms!!
